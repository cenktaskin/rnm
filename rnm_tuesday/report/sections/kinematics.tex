\section{Kinematics}
Kinematics, often regarded as 'geometry of motion' describes motion of points (or bodies) without considering the effect of forces \cite{wikikine}. Kinematics can be separated into four steps, which are namely forward and inverse kinematics, path and trajectory planning. In this section we will first introduce the theoretical background of the aforementioned four steps then outline the implementation that arose from this theory.
