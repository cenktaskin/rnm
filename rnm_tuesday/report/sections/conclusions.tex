\section{Conclusions}
Overall surgical needle insertion with the implementation of modern advancement in computer vision and robotics is an application of surgical robotics that is open for improvement. We employed such techniques to achieve precise needle inseriton, although the vision package wasn't functioning, we were able show functional navigation of the robot. We would like to thank the Institute of Medical Technology and Intelligent Systems for giving us the possibility of working with a real-life surgical robot.
