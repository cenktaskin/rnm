As forward kinematics determine the position and orientation of the end effector from joint variables, inverse kinematics determines the latter given the former. More generally, given a homogeneous transformation
$$
H = 
\begin{bmatrix}
R & p \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
find joint variables
$$
T_n^0(q_1,...,q_n) = H
$$
Although there are closed form solutions to the system of equations, as geometry of robot gets more complex they become hard to solve analytically. In this study we used a common approach to approximate the solution of systems, namely least squares. The least-squares method finds the optimal parameter values by  minimizing the sum of squared residuals

$$S=\sum_{i=1}^{n}r_i^2.$$
