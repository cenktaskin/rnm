Needle placement into the patients body is a necessary process employed in surgical applications.
Using modern techniques of robotics and image processing this process can be improved in terms of precision and safety.
This document outlines the implementation of the needle placement by a robot manipulator as a part of course work in Robotics and Navigation in Medicine at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH).
